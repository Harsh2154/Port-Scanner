# Port-Scanner
A multithreaded Python port scanner that checks for open ports and attempts to grab banners for services running on common ports such as HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and more. The results are displayed in the terminal, with the option to store the findings in a file. Open ports are highlighted in red for easy identification.
